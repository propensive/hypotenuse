- consistent representations of 8, 16, 32 and 64-bit signed and unsigned integers, and 32 and 64-bit floating point numbers
- uses opaque types and method inlining for native performance
- stricter typesafety over the standard Java/Scala primitive types
- opt-in range checking (e.g. overflow)
- distinct types for 8, 16, 32 and 64-bit bitmaps
- integration with standard mathematical operations (from `java.lang.Math`) through extension methods
- avoids implicit widening to `Int`
